//Description:
//There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.
//
//You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].
//
//Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.
//
//Return the time taken for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
//Output: 6
//Explanation:
//- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].
//- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].
//The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.
